## Portfolio Website

This website introduces me as a developer and showcases the cool things I've made.

Designed and implemented completely from scratch, I created my portfolio website in under 3 monthsâ€”having never written a line of HTML before. Through this project, I taught myself the design, development, and deployment skills needed to build clean and appealing web front-ends with full mobile compatability. 

The website also uses the GitHub **REST API** to dynamically fetch all my public GitHub projects and display information about them on the site, which is automatically updated every day using GitHub **workflow actions** and **scripts**.

My portfolio is live at: [https://sambrothers0.github.io](https://sambrothers0.github.io)
