Personal Website
This website introduces me as a developer and shows off the cool things I've made. Designed and implemented completely from scratch, I created my portfolio website in under 3 months, having never written a line of HTML in my life. With the design, development, and deployment skills I taught myself from this project, I can build clean and appealing web front-ends with full mobile compatibility. Github's REST API is also used to dynamically fetch all my public github projects and display info about them on the website, which is automatically updated every day using GitHub workflow actions and scripts. My portfolio is live at https://sambrothers0.github.io
